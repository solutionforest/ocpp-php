# OCPP-PHP

---

A PHP library for implementing the JSON version of the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP). This library supports **OCPP 1.6** (errata v4), **OCPP 2.0.1** (Edition 2 FINAL, 2022-12-15, and Edition 3 errata 2024-11).

The purpose of this library is to provide the building blocks to construct a **charging station/charge point** and/or **charging station management system (CSMS)/central system**. It is not a complete solution but rather a flexible toolkit for developers to build OCPP-compliant systems.

> **Note:** OCPP 2.0.1 includes fixes for all known issues in OCPP 2.0 and replaces it. Implementers are advised to use OCPP 2.0.1.

## Features

- Full support for OCPP 1.6 and OCPP 2.0.1.
- PHP implementation of essential OCPP components.
- Modular and extensible architecture for building custom solutions.
- WebSocket integration for real-time communication between charging stations and central systems.
